# Floorplan

The floorplan view enables you to lay out your things on an interactive floorplan of your home.

To navigate to the floorplan view, select the "Floorplan" option in the main menu.

From the edit floorplan view, click the "Upload floorplan..." button to upload a floorplan image of your home.

**ðŸ’¡ Tip:** You can upload any image file that can be rendered by web browsers including scanned images or even a photograph. For best results we recommend an SVG file with white lines and a transparent background.

Once you have uploaded your image, click the "âœ”" button at the bottom right of the screen to exit the edit view.
