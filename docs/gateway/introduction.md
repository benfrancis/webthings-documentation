# WebThings Gateway

*Host your own private smart home.*

[WebThings Gateway](https://webthings.io/gateway/) is a software distribution for smart home hubs focused on privacy, security and interoperability. It enables you to securely monitor and control your home over the web, without a middleman.

Features include:

 - Monitor and control all of your smart home [devices](../things) from a unified web interface
 - Create "if this then that" style [rules](../rules) to automate your home with a simple drag and drop interface
 - [Log](../logs) and visualise sensor data over time
 - Lay out all your devices on an interactive [floorplan](../floorplan) of your home for at-a-glance status and control
 - Add compatibility with more devices and protocols with adapter [add-ons](../settings#add-ons).

The gateway bridges a range of different smart home protocols to a standardised [Web of Things](../../wot/introduction) API.
