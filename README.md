# WebThings Documentation

This is the source code of the documentation for the [WebThings](https://webthings.io) software platform.

To generate a local copy:

- [Install](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/installation/) MkDocs

`$ pip install mkdocs`

- Serve the docs locally

`$ mkdocs serve`

You should then be able to access the docs at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and they will live reload as you edit the markdown files.

See the [MkDocs user guide](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/) for more.
